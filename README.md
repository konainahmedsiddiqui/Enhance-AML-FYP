Enhanced Anti-Money Laundering (AML) System 
Abstract:
This project addresses the growing issue of money laundering, which is a global financial 
threat, with an estimated $1.6 trillion laundered annually. Traditional Anti-Money 
Laundering (AML) methods often struggle to adapt to modern techniques, highlighting 
the need for more advanced detection systems. This research presents a comprehensive 
solution utilizing data mining and machine learning to enhance the efficiency of AML 
systems.
The proposed system consists of four primary components:
[1].Data Cleaning: Ensures high-quality financial transaction data by removing 
inconsistencies and inaccuracies.
[2].Mined Frequent Rules: Identifies transaction patterns and anomalies through 
rule-mining techniques such as FP-growth.
[3].Classifier Construction: Builds machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest 
and XGBoost) to detect suspicious transactions.
[4].Reporting: Provides dashboards and analytics tools to generate alerts and ensure 
compliance with financial regulations.
The objective of the project was to develop a robust and adaptable system capable of 
detecting suspicious transactions with improved accuracy, enhancing real-time 
monitoring capabilities, and facilitating compliance with global financial regulations.
Through a detailed review of current AML systems and their limitations, the project 
demonstrates how the integration of data mining techniques, machine learning algorithms, 
and visualization tools can substantially improve the detection of money laundering
activities. The system has been tested under realistic conditions and has shown promising 
results in enhancing detection accuracy, usability, and scalability.
This project contributes to the growing field of AML research by providing a solution that 
leverages advanced technologies to address modern challenges in financial crime 
detection. It is a practical tool that can benefit financial institutions, regulatory bodies, and 
law enforcement agencies in combating money laundering more effectively
