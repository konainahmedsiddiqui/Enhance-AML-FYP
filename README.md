# Enhanced Anti-Money Laundering (AML) System

## Abstract
This project addresses the growing issue of money laundering, which is a global financial threat, with an estimated $1.6 trillion laundered annually. Traditional Anti-Money Laundering (AML) methods often struggle to adapt to modern techniques, highlighting the need for more advanced detection systems. This research presents a comprehensive solution utilizing data mining and machine learning to enhance the efficiency of AML systems.

## System Components
The proposed system consists of four primary components:

1. **Data Cleaning**: Ensures high-quality financial transaction data by removing inconsistencies and inaccuracies.
2. **Mined Frequent Rules**: Identifies transaction patterns and anomalies through rule-mining techniques such as FP-growth.
3. **Classifier Construction**: Builds machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest and XGBoost) to detect suspicious transactions.
4. **Reporting**: Provides dashboards and analytics tools to generate alerts and ensure compliance with financial regulations.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a robust and adaptable system capable of:
- Detecting suspicious transactions with improved accuracy.
- Enhancing real-time monitoring capabilities.
- Facilitating compliance with global financial regulations.

## Approach
Through a detailed review of current AML systems and their limitations, the project demonstrates how the integration of:
- **Data mining techniques**
- **Machine learning algorithms**
- **Visualization tools**

Can substantially improve the detection of money laundering activities. The system has been tested under realistic conditions and has shown promising results in enhancing detection accuracy, usability, and scalability.

## Contributions
This project contributes to the growing field of AML research by providing a solution that leverages advanced technologies to address modern challenges in financial crime detection. It is a practical tool that can benefit:
- Financial institutions
- Regulatory bodies
- Law enforcement agencies

In combating money laundering more effectively.

## Results
The system has demonstrated:
- **Enhanced detection accuracy** for identifying suspicious transactions.
- **Improved usability** with intuitive dashboards and reporting tools.
- **Scalability** for handling large volumes of financial transaction data.

## Installation
